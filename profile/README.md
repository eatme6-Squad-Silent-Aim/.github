## 🎯 What is Silent Aim in Squad?

**Silent Aim** is a next-level cheat where your bullets **auto-lock to the enemy’s hitbox** — without visibly moving your crosshair. It’s not aim assist or aimbot — it’s **invisible lock-on** that fires perfect shots while your mouse stays still.

Think of it like having *aimbot behind the scenes* — full legit appearance, with full rage efficiency 😈
